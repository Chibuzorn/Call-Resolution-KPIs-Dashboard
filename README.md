## Project Objective
This project was developed for a telecommunications company facing challenges in understanding customer trends and KPIs. The goal was to create a dashboard that reflects key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide insights into overall customer satisfaction, agent performance, and call resolution trends.

---

## Dataset Used
The dataset comprises call data records that include variables such as resolution rates, call lengths, agent performance, customer satisfaction ratings, and more. Data cleaning processes such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing column headers were conducted to ensure data quality and consistency.

## Key Insights

### Overall Call Resolution Rate
- The dashboard shows an impressive **72.92% resolution rate**, indicating that nearly three-quarters of customer issues are resolved successfully during calls. This is a positive sign of effective customer service operations.

### Customer Satisfaction
- The **average satisfaction score** stands at **3.40** (on a scale of 0 to 5), which indicates moderate satisfaction levels. Improving the resolution process or agent interactions could enhance customer experiences.

### Agent Performance
- Individual agent statistics reveal key insights into their performance:
    - **Jim** answered the most calls (536), with a high satisfaction score of **3.48**.
    - **Dave**, despite answering fewer calls (464), achieved an average satisfaction score of **3.61**, demonstrating effective customer engagement.
    - The **average speed of answer** across agents is approximately **54.7 seconds**, with variations across team members.

### Top Topics by Calls
- Calls were categorized by topics such as technical issues, billing inquiries, and account management. **Technical issues** dominate the call categories, emphasizing the need for specialized training or resources to address such concerns efficiently.

### Monthly Trends
- The number of calls answered is consistent across months, with **February having the highest volume**. This could be due to billing cycles, promotional campaigns, or seasonal customer behavior.

## Dashboard Features
1. **Dynamic Visualizations**  
   - The dashboard employs dynamic elements such as slicers for date filtering, allowing users to explore KPIs for specific periods. It provides interactive and real-time insights to support decision-making.

2. **Key Metrics Display**  
   - KPIs such as the resolution rate, average satisfaction score, and agent statistics are prominently displayed for easy monitoring.

3. **Drill-Through Analysis**  
   - Users can drill through the data for deeper insights, such as comparing agent performance or exploring trends across months.

## Process Overview
1. **Data Cleaning**  
    - Addressed missing values and ensured consistency in column headers and data formats.
    - Applied transformations to create calculated measures like average satisfaction and resolution rates.

2. **Dashboard Creation**  
    - Developed visualizations to represent KPIs, trends, and customer behaviors.
    - Incorporated slicers and filters to enable dynamic interaction.

## Insights and Recommendations

1. **Agent Training**  
   - Invest in training agents to reduce the average speed of answer and improve satisfaction scores.

2. **Technical Support Focus**  
   - As technical issues dominate call topics, consider enhancing technical resources or FAQs for quicker resolutions.

3. **Customer Feedback Collection**  
   - Implement a post-call feedback system to gather insights on specific pain points and further improve customer satisfaction.

4. **Call Volume Management**  
   - Analyze peak call months to optimize staffing and resource allocation.

## Final Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to provide actionable insights into customer service operations. By addressing identified areas such as agent training and technical issue management, the telecommunications company can enhance overall customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. 

The dashboard not only highlights current performance but also serves as a strategic tool for continuous improvement in customer service.
